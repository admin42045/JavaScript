1: The ABC of Programming

2: Basic JavaScript Instructions
    
3: Functions, Methods & Objects

4: Decisions & Loops

5: Document Object Model ( DOM )
           1) Select An Individual Element Node
            -getElementById() -select element based on id
            -querySelector() -use css selector eg.[li.hot]

           2) Select Multiple Elements (Nodelists)
            -getElementsByClassName() -select element  based on className
            -getElementsByTagName()  -select element based on tagName eg.[li]
            -querySelectorAll() - use css selector eg.('li[id]');
            
           3) Traversing Between Element Nodes
            -parentNode    - this propeties find the element node for containing element in the html
            -previousSibling/nextSibling  -these properties find the prev and next element  sibling of a node 
            -firstChild / lastChild  -these properties find the first or last child of the current element

           4) Access & Update a text node by 
            -nodeValue() - Accessing text from node
            -textContent() -Gets /Sets text only
            -innerText  -Get/sets text only
            -innerHTML -Gets/Sets text & markup

           5) Adding Elements using DOM manipulations
            -createElement()  - create the element & this element node stored in variable
            -CreateTextNode() - create a new text node, after createElement() method , store in variable
            -appendChild() - add it to the DOM 

           6) Removing element from the DOM tree
            -removeChild() - remove the element into the DOM tree

           
           7) Attribute Nodes
            -getAttribute() -gets the value of an attribute
            -hasAttribute() -check if element node has a specified attribute
            -setAttribute() - sets the value of an attribute
            -removeAttriute() -removes an attribute from an element node

           8) document.write() -object document write() method  a single way to add conent that was not in the original source code  to the page,but it's use is rarely advised




6: Events

UIEVENTS   Occur when a user interacts with the browser's user interface (UI) rather than the web page 

EVENT 			DESCRIPTION 

load 			Web page has finished loading 
unload			Web page is unloading (usually because a new page was requested) 
error 			Browser encounters a JavaScript error or an asset doesn't exist 
resize 			Browser window has been resized 
scroll 			User has scrolled up or down the page 



KEYBOARD EVENTS   Occur when a user interacts with the keyboard (see also input event) 

EVENT 			DESCRIPTION 

keydown 		User first presses a key (repeats while key is depressed) 
keyup 			User releases a key 
keypress 		Character is being inserted (repeats while key is depressed) 

 
MOUSE EVENTS     Occur when a user interacts with a mouse. trackpad, or touchscreen 

EVENT 			DESCRIPTION 

click 			User presses and releases a button over the same element 
dbl 			click User presses and releases a button twice over the same element 
mousedown 		User presses a mouse button while over an element 
mouseup 		User releases a mouse button while over an element 
mousemove 		User moves the mouse (not on a touchscreen) 
mouseover 		User moves the mouse over an element (not on a touchscreen) 
mouseout 		User moves the mouse off an element (not on a touchscreen) 



FOCUS EVENTS   Occur when an element (e.g., a link or form field) gains or loses focus 

EVENT 			    DESCRIPTION 
focus / focus in	Element gains focus 
blur / focusout		Element loses focus 





 
FORM EVENTS 		Occur when a user interacts with a form element 

EVENT 			DESCRIPTION

input 			Value in any <input> or <textarea> element has changed (IE9+) or any element with the contented i table attribute 
change 			Value in select box, checkbox, or radio button changes (IE9+) 
submit 			User submits a form (using a button or a key) 
reset 			User clicks on a form's res~t button (rarely used these days) 
cut 			User cuts content from a form field 
copy 			User copies content from a form field 
paste 			User pastes content into a form field 
selec           User selects some text in a form field



MUTATION EVENTS* 	Occur when the DOM structure has been changed by a script  *To be replaced by mutation observers (see p284) 
	
EVENT 				DESCRIPTION 

DOMSubtreeModified 		    Change has been made to document
DOMNodelnserted 		    Node has been inserted as a direct child of another node
DOMNodeRemoved 			    Node has been removed from another node 
OOMNodelnsertedlntoDocument Node has been inserted as a descendant of another node 
DOMNodeRemovedFromOocument 	Node has been removed as a descendant of another node
