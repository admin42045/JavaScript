3: Functions, Methods & Objects

4: Decisions & Loops

5: Document Object Model ( DOM )
           1) Select An Individual Element Node
            -getElementById()
            -querySelector()

           2) Select Multiple Elements (Nodelists)
            -getElementsByClassName()
            -getElementsByTagName()
            -querySelectorAll()
            
           3) Traversing Between Element Nodes
            -parentNode
            -previousSibling/nextSibling
            -firstChild / lastChild

           4) Access & Update a text node by 
            -nodeValue()
            -textContent()
            -innerText
            -innerHTML
           5) Adding Elements using DOM manipulations
            -createElement()
            -CreateTextNode()
            -appendChild()
           6) Removing element from the DOM tree
            -removeChild()

           7) Attribute Nodes
            -getAttribute()
            -hasAttribute()
            -setAttribute()
            -removeAttriute()
